Using plural mechanism design, we experiment with novel ways to surface ideas in the public interest that transcend our biases—protocol, politics, purse— while encouraging collaboration and insights across unlikely intersections where breakthroughs tend to emerge.',

Through a series of structured interactions, the community will decide how to prioritize research and allocate funds, relying on structured, high-bandwidth deliberations that surface research public goods, while elevating truth and expertise with peer prediction.  The community is interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from science of science, social science, economics, complexity science, cryptography, and philosophy, among other intersections. The community will test and evolve these mechanisms through multiple cycles of feedback and adaptation.',
